				From birth, each of us is distinguished from others by our personal profile, that is, the genetic and physical characteristics which we inherit from our parents and ancestors. Identity however is not only individual. The question, ‘Who am I?’ is deeply linked to that of, ‘Who are we?’ – ‘we’ being for example the ethnic group, the nation or the faith of which we are members. As members of a group we are linked to other members primarily through language, beliefs, rituals, moral code, customs, food, clothes and so on. All forms of a country’s heritage help a nation define its cultural identity. Without culture we have no identity and as part of our identity, access to participation in and enjoyment of cultural expression and heritage are basic human rights
