You must be present to receive the present that awaits your arrival. You must go through the valleys of life which means the ups and downs to get to that place of purpose.</p>

					<h3> The Snake</h3>
					<p>“Snakes are sometimes perceived as evil, but they are also perceived as medicine. If you look at an ambulance, there’s the two snakes on the side of the ambulance. The caduceus, or the staff of Hermes, there’s the two snakes going up it, which means that the venom can also be healing.” ~ Nicolas Cage</p>
