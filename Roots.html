			<h1 style="text-align: center;">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1>
			<p>
				Not all of us have the privillage of having brothers and sisters of the same mother and father. This makes it difficult to track our relatives and to know how related are you to some of your relatives. Here is my case to paint the picture clear: <br>
				<br>
				Most families do not make it past the 4th generation. I mean where you have a great-grandmother and great-grandfather and all their descendents can identify one another. Not necesseraly that they should be both alive. I don't know about you, but I want my descendents to know one another. I don't want a case where they are unknowingly dating each other. <br>
				<br>
				Having your descendents identifying one another is a very difficult task. This is what makes it difficult:<br>
				Great-grandparents have children your grandparents. At this stage your grandparents can easily identify one another as sisters and brothers. Later your grandparents get married and produce their own children. These children are your mother/father, aunties and uncles. They can identify their relatives as brothers, sisters and cousin. In most cases they don't grow-up together, they casually meet at family gatherings. Now your mother/father begotten you and your brothers and sisters. You can identify relatives from your grandparents (mother/father parents) but it becomes difficult identifying your relatives from grandparents that are your mother/father's uncles and aunties. <br>
				<br>
				This is the half of it. Let us say the above case great-grandparents are from your maternal side, you still have to identify relatives from your paternal side of the family.<br>
				This is just from the 4th generation which is about 100 years old and it is difficult for us to know all of our relatives. <br>
				<br>
				For us who don't have same mother and father with our half-brothers and half-sisters it becomes very difficult to identify our relatives which will make it harder for our descendents to identify one another as relatives. <br>

			<h1 style="text-align: center;">PROPOSED SOLUTION</h1>
			<p>
				I believe that the Roots web application will ease the burden on identifying your relatives. Imagine a Web Application where you'd upload details of your great-grandparents: names and surname, birth dates, health history and where they grew-up. Below your great-grandparents, you'd upload details of your grandparents and below them, you'd upload details of your parents, aunties and uncles. And below your parents, you'd upload details of you, your brothers and sisters, your cousins and your distance cousins. <br>
				<br>
				Your great-grandparents will be linked to your grandparents by a line signifying same lineage. Same will apply to your grandparents and your parents and from your parents to you. I think it will be easier to see the picture I'm trying to paint if you know the theory of evolution. The one that says we are related with the chimpazees and we from the same ancestors 'the apes'. <br>
				<br>
				Starting from the 1st generation 'great-grandparents' to the 4th generation, the picture will spread like the roots. This is how I chose the name of the application. Not only that this will be a web application but it can also be a trademark that every family has on their wall. I mean it could be printed to an A3 paper. And when there is a new family member 'a baby', info will be added to the web application and the family picture can be reprinted with all the family member details. <br>

			<p>
				The family profile can be created by a single member of the family and if another member of the family uses the application, the information about him/her will be readily available. For example, lets say you have created your profile and your cousin of which you share same grandparents, unkowingly re-creates the family profile. The information about the maternal/paternal side of the family will be readily available. <br>
