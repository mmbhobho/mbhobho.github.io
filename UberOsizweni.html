			<h1 style="text-align: center;">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1>
			<p>
				The system used by taxi drivers to find passenders is inefficient. The taxi driver drives in search of passengers.<br> This has a few drawbacks. <br>
				  <br>1. Petrol is wasted which is costly. <br>
				  2. Passengers spend too much time waiting for a taxi.<br>
				  3. Driving in search of the passengers is tiring and can be fraustrating for the taxi driver.<br>
				  4. Old-aged, disabled and sick people need a second person who will catch a taxi for them</p>

				 <br><p class="current">Newcastle Case Study </p>

				 <br><p>In a township called Osizweni, taxis known as "Amaphela" transport passengers. Most of these taxis are private cars 
				 carrying less than 4 passengers . On avarage the taxi drivers make R250 per day. It is estimated that there are 
				 200 taxis, making it a ~R50 000 per day unregulated taxi industry. Unlike Uber and Taxify, taxi drivers can carry other passengers while transporting a passenger who first boarded the taxi. This has a drawback: <br>

				  <br>5. Passengers spend too much on a ride while the driver is transporting other passengers. <br>
				  6. Petrol is wasted while the driver is transporting passengers to different destinations. <br>

				  <br> Siyaya, Nyathis and Quantums transport passengers in a township called Madadeni. Madadeni taxis are known to be the most 
				  ineffecient and poor system. These taxis "mini-Bus" can carry upto 16 passengers. Also, these taxi drivers blindly drive in search of passengers. Madadeni taxis are responsible for transporting passengers going and coming from Osizweni and are responsible for transporting passengers to different sections in Madadeni. <br>

				  <br> 7. There are few taxis that transport passengers going and coming from Osizweni. Passengers spend more time 
				  waiting for a taxi. <br>
				  8. A trip from Madadeni to Osizweni and vice versa results in boarding 3 different taxis. Passengers only pay a 
				  single fee, but the trip can last upto 3 hours. This trip takes less than 20min when driving a private car. What 
				  happens is that a taxi driver drives in search for passengers. He takes both passengers going to different sections in 
				  Madadeni and going to Osizweni. When he has driven to the end section of Madadeni, passengers going to Osizweni 
				  board into a second taxi in a taxi rank. Passengers wait in a taxi rank as other taxi drivers repeat the process of 
				  searching for passengers and delivering them in a taxi rank. The taxi leaves the taxi rank when it is full, going to Osizweni. When this taxi reaches the first section of Osizweni it stops, waiting for a taxi leaving the taxi rank 
				  with passengers. These two taxis now share passengers according to their destinations. <br>

				  <br> On avarage 20 taxis transport passengers both from Osizweni to Madadeni and Madadeni to Osizweni. The trip costs R15 passenger. This makes OsizwenitoMadadeni taxi transport to be worth ~R5000 per day. This excludes Madadeni taxi transport that transports passengers to different sections within Madadeni. <br>

				  <br>Siyaya's and Quantums transport passengers from Osizweni and Madadeni to Newcastle and from Newcastle to Madadeni and Osizweni. Number of these taxis in the road is regulated by the Newcastle taxi assosiation. <br>

				  <br> 9. On busy days, there are sections that taxi drivers do not drive through. This forces passengers from these sections to take "Amaphela" so they could place them in sections where most of taxis going to Newcastle pass through. A trip to Newcastle becomes costlier to these passengers. <br>

				  <br> 10. On not so busy days, taxi drivers transport fewer passengers to Newcastle. <br>

				  <br> As for the case of Amaphela, the ride fee is fixed for all the passengers irrespective of distance travelled, time of the day, and traffic conjestion. But what if there was a system that was going to ease the burden on the taxi drivers, constantly working for petrol garage, forever in search for passengers, having to drive all day to meet the target of the taxi owner. A system that will make it easy for passengers to request a taxi, that will take less time to reach your destination and that will result in a passenger paying a fair fee for a ride.

			<h1 style="text-align: center;">PROPOSED SOLUTION</h1>
			<p>
				That system is Uber. UberOsizweni, UberMadadeni and UberNewcastle. <br>
				Unlike Uber, the system does not seek out to get rid of the current taxi transport system. It is seeking to help both drivers and passengers. <br>

				<br>1. The driver will not waste petrol searching for passengers, as whereabouts of the passenger will be available on the Uber App <br>
				2. Passengers will not wait longer as request will be sent to all the drivers. <br>
				3. Drivers will have a time to relax when there are fewer or no passengers requesting. A taxi driver will only drive if there are passengers requesting. <br>
				4. Old-aged, disabled and sick people can now request a taxi at their homes. <br>
				5. This Uber system will be implemented such that it will advice the driver to pick passengers going to similar places. This will make a ride to be quicker for passengers. <br>
				6. This will also be advantageous to the driver, as this will cost the him less petrol.<br>
				7. This Uber System will improve Madadeni taxi transport as taxi drivers will know exactly the number of passengers in Osizweni going to Madadeni and vice versa. Passengers will know location of the driver in turn this will inform the passenger how long he/she will wait for the taxi. <br>
				8. Taxi drivers will now pick passengers going to similar destinations. Drivers will now quickly find passengers going to similar destinations, before they had to drive in search for passengers. Now they drive to pick a passenger to a specific location which is quicker. <br>
				9. The Uber system will show the number of passengers on busy days and this inturn will persuade the taxi assosiation to increase the number of taxis during the busy days. This will help the passengers in sections where taxis do not drive through on busy days.<br>
				10. The reason for taxi drivers to pick up fewer passengers on not so busy days is because they blindly search for passengers. Using the Uber System, the taxi driver will pick more passengers. <br>

				<br> This Uber system will allow the passengers to negotiate a ride fee through the application. Ride fee can also be made according to the distance travelled, time of the day, weather and traffic conjestion.<br>

				<br> This Uber system will require both passengers and drivers to have an android application on their cellphones. Taxi owners will now know the exact amount that their drivers made. <br>

			<p>
				A PC, database and Android studio and a couple of programming skills are all that is needed to develop this Uber app. <br> 
				<br>1. Time: developing the Uber application can take up-to a month, but it could take much longer as I will be busy with other chores. <br>
				2. Data Bundles: Internet is needed to communicate with the database while developing the application.<br> 
				3. Even passengers and drivers need data bundles to use the application.

			<h1 style="text-align: center;">END GOAL</h1>
			<p> <br>
			I think the purpose of every business is to make a profit. I too am looking forward to making a profit in this Uber app. How, you ask? Well like every big software company, I will start making profit when many users are using my application. The ideal case is when the driver has transported 80%  of passengers using the Uber App. <br> <br>
			<p class="current">Ideal case</p>
			<br>
			Let us say a driver has made R250  through Uber app. Each ride cost R10, that means a driver has transported 25 passengers. I take 50 cents from every passenger.<br> 50 cents x 25 = R12.50 <br> I make R12.50 from each driver. And if there are 200 drivers using Uber Application <br>R12.50 x 200 = R2 500.<br> I make R2 500 a day, monthly that would be <br>R2 500 x 30 = R75 000. <br>Mind you this case is only for "Amaphela", Madadeni taxi transport and Newcastle taxi transport are not included. <br> <br>
			This is how I intend to make profit but it will happen only if this application blows up
