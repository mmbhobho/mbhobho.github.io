			<h1 style="text-align: center;">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1>
			<p>
				Most of the engineering students perform badly on their assessments: <br> 
				• tests <br> 
				• practicals <br> 
				• and exams <br> 
				<br>
				Studying alone is not sufficient to pass these assessments. Students can improve their marks by using past assessment materials. But past assessment material is not readily available. Some of the engineering students manage to get these materials from students who had done those assessments. <br>
				<br>
				Past assessment materials is stored in the cloud. Students who have access to assessments stored in the cloud, share links to other students so they can also have access. To have access to the files stored in the cloud, a student has to be friends with other students who has access to the files in the cloud. If students who have access to the cloud don't like you, you don't get access to these files. <br>
				<br>
				A student who has completed a degree no longer has access to the study material on moodle. And these files can be of use if a graduate wants to recap for an interview. And some of the material can be required at work or if a graduate is working on a project requiring information gained while studying. <br>
